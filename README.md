# DFCNN-based-MTJ-segmentation-in-ultrasound-images
 The displacement of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) obtained by ultrasound imaging is essential to understand the mechanics and pathological conditions of the muscle-tendon unit during motion. This paper presents an automatic method to measure the MTJ through segmenting an effective MTJ region. The ultrasound images were first preprocessed with level-setbased method. Followed by the application of a proposed fully convolutional neural networks (FCNN), the MTJ regions were successfully predicted and thus the MTJ displacement among consecutive ultrasound images was achieved. Preliminary tests were conducted on a normal subject, and the feasibility was demonstrated.
